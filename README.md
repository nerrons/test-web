# Project: test-web

This is the GitHub repository for the project you named "test-web", generated from the "yaxt-tinysites-tufte" website template at [yax.com](https://yax.com).

From here, deploy your website for free hosting. Just click a button to deploy your website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Render.com](https://render.com/). During the process, you will create a second repo for deployment. Name it what you like; I suggest "test-web-deploy".

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/nerrons/test-web)

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/nerrons/test-web)

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

# Tiny Site: Tufte

This is a one page "tiny site" built using the [yax.com](https://yax.com/) website builder project.

The page is styled with the [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) stylesheet by [Dave Liepmann](https://www.daveliepmann.com/) and [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/).

## Using the on-page editor

You can edit the page using the [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) on-page editor. Use the link `https://example.com/index.html?login` to open the edit toolbar. Click "Edit" in the toolbar to begin editing.
